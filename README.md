# Robust_least_squares

As a part of university coursework, I authored a paper deriving the foundational theory for approximation in Hilbert spaces, developed an enhanced least squares method to correct for outliers and impelemented it in MATLAB. This repository contains the materials and code for the paper. Below is an overview of the included files and instructions for using the code.

## File Structure

- **`main.m`**: This MATLAB file contains the main code for the project.
- **`Robust_least_squares.pdf`**: This PDF file provides a comprehensive explanation of the theory, methodology, and results related to the project.

## Running the Code

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open `main.m` in MATLAB.
2. Locate the section in the code where the polynomial degree is set. Modify the degree as desired by changing the corresponding variable.
3. Save the changes to `main.m` and run the script in MATLAB.

4. **Important**: Note that the numerical algorithm can become unstable for higher degree polynomials.
