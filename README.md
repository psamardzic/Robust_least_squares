# Robust_least_squares

This repository contains the materials and code for my university term paper. Below is an overview of the included files and instructions for using the code.

## File Structure

- **`main.m`**: This MATLAB file contains the main code for the project.
- **`Robust_least_squares.pdf`**: This PDF file provides a comprehensive explanation of the theory, methodology, and results related to the project.

## Running the Code

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open `main.m` in MATLAB.
2. Locate the section in the code where the polynomial degree is set. Modify the degree as desired by changing the corresponding variable.
3. Save the changes to `main.m` and run the script in MATLAB.

4. **Important**: Note that the numerical algorithm can become unstable for higher degree polynomials.
